# CSE 507 Ark+ Container

This repository contains modified Ark+ code for CSE 507. A container for this code is also provided, and can be downloaded by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
wget "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/u2rk1siz34lcokuifejqw/nvidia.sif?rlkey=dk0jprx8xvnxnjddjwopvqmbz&st=hmn0kvkc&dl=1" -O containers/nvidia/nvidia.sif
```

After downloading the above container, you can run experiments using the following instructions

## Experiment Scripts

The experiment_scripts directory provides scripts for running experiments. Scripts are provided for easily running the following five experiments:

- vindr_cxr_only: Train a student/teacher Ark model on VinDr-CXR only.
- chestxray14_only: Train a student/teacher Ark model on ChestX-ray14 only.
- vindr_cxr_chestxray14_cyclic: Train a student/teacher Ark model on VinDr-CXR and ChestX-ray14 cyclically.
- vindr_cxr_chestxray14_concurrent_random_sampling: Train a student/teacher Ark model on VinDr-CXR and ChestX-ray14 concurrently with random sampling.
- vindr_cxr_chestxray14_concurrent_equal_sampling: Train a student/teacher Ark model on VinDr-CXR and ChestX-ray14 concurrently with equal sampling.

(For practice 1/demo 1 you should run the experiments in the above order)

### Running Experiments

A start and resume script are provided for each of the experiments, and they both require a seed as an argument. They should be run by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
# Start experiment (replace vindr_cxr_only with the experiment name, and enter any seed)
./experiment_scripts/vindr_cxr_only/start_vindr_cxr_only.sh 100

# Resume experiment (use the same seed as when you started the experiment)
./experiment_scripts/vindr_cxr_only/resume_vindr_cxr_only.sh 100
```

The resume scripts will resume training from the latest completed epoch/cycle.

## Experiment Output

Each training run creates a directory in the repository root named
`<experiment>_seed_<seed>`, such as `vindr_cxr_only_seed_100`. The main
outputs are organized as follows:

```text
<experiment>_seed_<seed>/
├── train.log
├── loss.csv
├── evaluation/
│   └── <dataset>/
│       ├── val_performance.csv
│       └── test_performance.csv
├── models/
│   ├── weights/
│   │   └── epoch_<cycle>/
│   │       ├── manifest.json
│   │       ├── student_cycle_<cycle>_<experiment>_seed_<seed>.pth
│   │       └── teacher_cycle_<cycle>_<experiment>_seed_<seed>.pth
│   └── checkpoints/
│       └── cycle_<cycle>_<experiment>_seed_<seed>.pth.tar
└── snapshots/
    └── cycle_<cycle>/
        └── [<dataset>/]
            ├── student.jpeg
            └── teacher.jpeg
```

- `train.log` contains the configuration, training progress, validation and
  test metrics, and checkpoint messages.
- `loss.csv` contains the per-batch classification, consistency, and total
  losses, their percentages, learning rate, and teacher momentum.
- `evaluation/<dataset>/` contains CSV results for both the student and
  teacher. Rows include the cycle, epoch, evaluation point, metric name, and
  student/teacher values.
- `models/weights/` stores student and teacher weights after every cycle.
- `models/checkpoints/` stores resumable checkpoints every 10 cycles and the
  latest completed cycle.

When a dataset's validation and test samples are identical, the separate
validation pass is skipped and the test measurement is also recorded in the
validation performance file. Otherwise, validation and test evaluation are
recorded separately after each task or joint update.

## Analyzing Results of Experiments

Plotting scripts are also provided for easily analyzing the results of experiments you run using this repository. Matplotlib is required for creating the plots. On sol, you can use matplotlib by running the following commands:

```bash
ml mamba
conda create -n plot python matplotlib
source activate plot
```

See the plot/ directory for more information on how to run the plotting scripts.
